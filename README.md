This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Notes

## Server Components VS Client Components

- [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)
- [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)

- BY DEFAULT, NEXT.JS USES SERVER COMPONENTS !!!!
- To use Client Components, you can add the React "use client" directive

### Server Components

Benefits :

- data fetching
- security
- caching
- bundle size

Data Fetching: Server Components allow you to move data fetching to the server, closer to your data source. This can improve performance by reducing time it takes to fetch data needed for rendering, and the amount of requests the client needs to make.
Security: Server Components allow you to keep sensitive data and logic on the server, such as tokens and API keys, without the risk of exposing them to the client.
Caching: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users. This can improve performance and reduce cost by reducing the amount of rendering and data fetching done on each request.
Bundle Sizes: Server Components allow you to keep large dependencies that previously would impact the client JavaScript bundle size on the server. This is beneficial for users with slower internet or less powerful devices, as the client does not have to download, parse and execute any JavaScript for Server Components.
Initial Page Load and First Contentful Paint (FCP): On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page.
Search Engine Optimization and Social Network Shareability: The rendered HTML can be used by search engine bots to index your pages and social network bots to generate social card previews for your pages.
Streaming: Server Components allow you to split the rendering work into chunks and stream them to the client as they become ready. This allows the user to see parts of the page earlier without having to wait for the entire page to be rendered on the server.

- if we want user to interact with our component and in order to make the component the client component, we need to use the use client directive.

### Routes

- [sign-in] : we are making reference to the fact that we are expecting a param on that path.
- [...sign-in]: we are expecting all the params sent to us on that path. example assuming our fixed path is `auth` , our path would look like this : `/auth/falopa/falopita/falopon` . everything after auth, will be taken as params and concatenated into an array like `{ 'sign-in': [ 'falopa', 'falopita', 'falopon' ] }`.
- [[[...sign-in]]]: we are saying that the `page.tsx` file inside the `[[[...sign-in]]]` folder (if there is no `page.tsx` in its parent) will be the default path to the parent folder of `[[[...sign-in]]]` .

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
